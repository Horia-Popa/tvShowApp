### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. cd [/tvShowApp]
3. npm install
4. npm start

# For Android

```
npm run android
```

# For iOS

npm run ios
```

If it doesn't run, please open Xcode and open the `tvShowApp.xcworkspace` file inside the ios folder.

## Technologies & Design Decisions

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native CLI (TypeScript)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **API Integration**: Custom fetch wrapper
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Persistence**: AsyncStorage
- **Styling**: StyleSheet
- **Icons**: FontAwesome
- **Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture:

The app follows a modular component-based approach with clear separation of concerns between UI, data fetching, and state management. This increases the maintainability and testability of the codebase.

#### Folder structure rationale

```bash
tvShowApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ android/
â”œâ”€â”€ ios/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ showService.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ episode/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stores/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useShowStore.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useFavoriteStore.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ jest.config.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### State Management:

Zustand was chosen for state management because of its simplicity and light footprint. Two main stores were implemented:

1. **ShowStore**: Manages show data, episodes, and cast information fetched from the TVMaze API
2. **FavoriteStore**: Handles user favorites with persistence using AsyncStorage

### Data Fetching:

The app uses a custom wrapper around the Fetch API to handle data retrieval from the TVMaze API. The implementation includes:

- Type-safe API responses
- Error handling
- Loading state management
- Caching strategies for improved performance

### UI/UX:

The UI design focuses on showcasing the rich visual content from the show with:

- Large hero images for the show and episodes
- Horizontal scrolling lists for easy browsing
- Season filters for quick navigation
- Visually distinct favorites functionality
- Clean typography and spacing for readability

### Testing:

The application includes comprehensive unit tests for:

- Zustand stores (showStore and favoriteStore)
- API service functions

### Persistence:

User favorites are persisted locally using AsyncStorage via Zustand's persist middleware, ensuring favorites remain available across app restarts.

## Future Improvements

To enhance the app further, potential improvements include:

- Adding search functionality for episodes and cast
- Implementing episode filtering by various criteria (rating, favorites)
- Creating a more detailed cast member profile screen
- Implementing push notifications for encouragement to watch again favorite episodes
- Adding a dark mode theme option
- Expanding test coverage to include more UI components
- Adding end-to-end tests with Detox

## API Integration

The app connects to the TVMaze API to fetch show data:

- Show info: https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/44458
- Episode list: https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/44458/episodes
- Cast: https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/44458/cast
- Episode by Id: https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1874762
